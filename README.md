To Do:
--------------------

~~1. Install Ack and the_silver_searcher for Vim~~

~~2. Set up to toggle relative line numbers~~

3. Finish install.sh (set up links)

~~4. Make sure local vimrc/bashrc etc. are being sourced~~

5. Improve bash/R history so that it's not case sensitive.

~~6. Find an autocompleter~~
